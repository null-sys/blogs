This is my first blog using [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/en/). Docusaurus is a product of Facebook Open Source.

<!--truncate-->

I came to know about Docusaurus by a recent [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8oIiS3xGxFk) of Siraj Raval. I started using docusaurus from last night. Starting was a bit frustating, but it has becomes handy. 

Why am i using docusaurus? 

My expectations are following :

* Getting a good experience in documentation
* Will be useful for [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com)
* Blogs (obviously)
* Documenting my upcoming projects.
